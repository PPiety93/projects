 <p>This project was my final project for my class in Introduction to Web Development at Bellevue College. The assignment was to create a multi-page game site that includes a review of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts covered in class.</p>
            <p>I designed the game Rock, Paper, Scissors from scratch using pictures and JS functions. The other games was from some tutorials from internet.</p>
